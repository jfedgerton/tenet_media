# Tenet Media / Foreign-Influence Podcast Analysis

Did Russian funding routed through **Tenet Media** change how three treated podcasts
(Benny Johnson, Dave Rubin, and Tim Pool — his three feeds pooled) discuss
Russia/Ukraine, relative to ~280 control conservative podcasts? The project transcribes
~212K episodes, models topics, classifies **stance** toward Russia/Ukraine, and uses
difference-in-differences / synthetic-control designs to measure shifts in stance,
agenda emphasis, and agenda divergence around the payment period.

**Treatment date:** `2023-10-01` — the first RT payment to Tenet (DOJ indictment: wires
Oct 2023–Aug 2024), ~1 month before Tenet's public Nov-2023 launch. Panel 2018-01 →
2024-08, truncated at the Sept 4 2024 indictment.

## Measurement (important — this is stance, not sentiment)

The analyses use **human + machine stance labeling on the Russia/Ukraine topics**, not an
off-the-shelf sentiment model:

1. **Topics.** BERTopic over the full corpus locates the Russia/Ukraine topics (78, 79).
2. **Human coding.** A sample of topic-78/79 sentences is hand/LLM-coded for *stance toward
   the target* (the validation set).
3. **Machine labeling.** A transformer classifier distilled from that human-validated set
   labels all ~444K topic-78/79 sentences — 4 classes per target: positive / negative /
   neutral / unmentioned.

Outcomes per target: `score` = p_pos − p_neg, `pos` = positive rate, `net` = (pos − neg)
ordinal. **Combined** = Russia − Ukraine (anti-Ukraine ≈ pro-Russia). The earlier generic
**sentiment** pass is deprecated and not used anywhere in the current pipeline.

## Hypotheses
- **H1** — treated hosts were already more pro-Russia *before* the payments (selection).
- **H2** — the payments pushed them further pro-Russia / anti-Ukraine (treatment).
- **H3** — the payments changed the *agenda* (Russia's share of total discussion).
- **H4** — treated hosts ran a more *divergent overall agenda* (divisive non-Russia content).

## Pipeline (article order)

Files live in `code/`. Steps `01`–`11` are the data → topic → stance-labeling construction
(HPC/SLURM); `12` builds the panels; `13`+ is the R analysis layer. Multi-script steps use
letter suffixes (e.g. `10a–10e`, `11a–11e`). **(todo)** = not yet written.

## Designs
OLS / Mahalanobis-matched level comparison (H1); TWFE (`fixest`) + synthetic control
(`quadprog` simplex weights, in-space placebo p-values) for H2/H3; Jensen-Shannon agenda
divergence vs. the contemporaneous control consensus for H4. Time-varying total-words and
month/host fixed effects as controls. Seed 123 throughout.

## Data (not in this repo)
Audio, transcripts, `corpus_with_topics.parquet`, the BERTopic model, and `master_*`
result files are git-ignored. The repo tracks the code and the labeled stance corpus
(`data/sc_results/opus_c0_corpus_labeled.parquet`) plus the show-month panels
(`data/sc_results/*.csv`). HPC paths assume the ROAR Collab layout
`/storage/group/LiberalArts/default/jfe4_collab/podcast/`.

## Running
HPC steps are SLURM jobs (`sbatch`); the R modeling layer (`13`, `15`, `16`, `17`, `20`,
`21`–`25`) runs in RStudio locally or on Roar with `module load r` — repoint the `CO`/`SC`
path variables at the top of each script to where the panel CSVs live. PI: Jared Edgerton (PSU).

## Changes from the earlier draft
- **Renumbered into article order** (Data → Topic → Stance → Panels → H1/H2/H3 → H4 →
  Grid → Robustness), replacing the old build-order numbering.
- **Replaced "sentiment" with human + machine stance labeling on the topics**; the prior
  off-the-shelf sentiment version is deprecated and removed from the pipeline.
- **H1/H2/H3 consolidated into one script** (`13_main_h1h3.R`), written sequentially
  (no loop), 3 outcomes × 3 operationalizations.
- **H4 split into its own script** (`15_main_h4.R`), with its topic-model panel at `14`.
- **`16_grid_h1h2.R`** to additionally output positive/negative comment-volume counts for
  Russia/Ukraine/Combined *(content edit pending)*.
- **Archived** superseded scripts (`15_main_analyses.R`, `30_h1_main.R`,
  `29_best_h1_ci.R`) under `code/archive/`.
